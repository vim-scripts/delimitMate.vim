This plug-in provides automatic closing of quotes, parenthesis, brackets, etc., besides some other related features that should make your time in insert mode a little bit easier, like syntax awareness (will not insert the closing delimiter in comments and other configurable regions), visual wrapping, <CR> and <Space> expansions (off by default), and some more.

Most of the features can be modified or disabled permanently, using global variables, or on a FileType basis, using :autocmd.

i.e.: The following line in your vimrc would turn auto-completion off for the "mail" file type:

        au FileType mail let b:delimitMate_autoclose = 0

Read :help delimitMate for detailed information. You can also follow the "Vim wiki" link on the top to discuss about this script.
